Ingredients

2 glasses (to the brim) lukewarm water
1 level glass fine semolina
1/2 glass all purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 tablespoon yeast

Heat a small non-stick skillet over medium heat. Stir the batter, and use a ladle to pour batter into the hot skillet. Pour carefully and slowly into the center and the batter will spread evenly into a circle. (Do not swirl the pan as you would for a crepe; the batter should spread itself.) Make the beghrir as large as you like.

Bubbles should appear on the surface of the beghrir as it cooks. Don't flip the beghrir. It only gets cooked on one side.

Cook for about two minutes, or until the beghrir doesn't appear wet anywhere on the surface. It should feel spongy, but not sticky or gummy, when you touch it lightly with your finger. 

Transfer the beghrir to cool in a single layer on a clean kitchen towel. Once they are cool, they can be stacked without sticking.

Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve plain with toppings on the side, or dip the pancakes in hot syrup.

(See tips below.)

Leftover beghrir are best stored in the freezer, with a small piece of plastic wrap or wax paper between each pancake.
